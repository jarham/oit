Fill in the perspective in the box intended for it. You can add as many perspectives into your graph as you wish - just press the button "Add perspective".</p><p><i>Perspective</i> is a lens through which you can look at or observe the issue, such as a financial perspective, an ethical perspective or an educational perspective.</p><p><b>SEARCH FOR ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THE CLAIM</b></p><p>Use the Internet to search for arguments for and against the issue. Fill in the arguments in the boxes intended for them and also add the source where you found the argument. You can add the source by copying the address of the web page into the space meant for it.</p><p>An <i>"argument for"</i> is an idea or evidence that supports the claim. It presents an idea about why a person should accept the claim whereas an <i>"argument against"</i> presents an idea about why a person should not accept the claim.</p><p><b>EVALUATE RELIABILITY OF THE SOURCE</b></p><p>Next, evaluate the credibility of the web site where you found the argument(s) with the help of the traffic lights:</p><p>Click on the green light if you think that you can trust the information on the Web site. Click on the yellow light if you think that information on the Web site is somewhat reliable. Click on the red light if you question the reliability of information on the Web site.</p><p>Type the reasons why you think that the source is reliable, somewhat reliable or questionable in the box that will appear beside the traffic lights. Type OK when you are done and the box will be hidden. You can see your comments again later by clicking on the traffic light.</p><p><b>SYNTHESIS WITHIN THE PERSPECTIVE</b></p><p>After you have written down the arguments for and against the issue, ponder them and sum up the key ideas in the synthesis box. You can also add your own thoughts to your synthesis.</p><p>A <i>synthesis</i> ties both arguments for and against and your own thoughts together. You can use relevant connector words (e.g. In contrast, in addition) to indicate how you think the ideas are related.</p><p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></p><p>Finally, type your conclusion in the box below the argument graph according to your teacher’s instructions.</p><p><b>SAVING AND PRINTING YOUR GRAPH</b></p><p>Follow these steps to save your argument graph file for later use.</p><ol><li>From the menu located on the top left corner of the graph, click "SAVE CHART" <li>Name your chart in the box that appears below the menu. <li>Click SAVE. The bar that appears in the bottom of the page will ask you whether you would like to save your chart. <li>Click the arrow beside the save button and <b>choose SAVE AS</b>. Then choose the location for saving the file on your computer. Once you have clicked Save, your file is saved in that location on your computer.</ol><p><b>OPENING YOUR GRAPH</b></p><p>There are two ways to open your saved argument graph later:</p><ol><li>If your argument graph is finished and you want to print a summary of it, double-click the file name in the location where you saved your graph and it will open. <li>If you want to continue filling in your graph, go to the argument graph website at <a target="_blank" href="http://pohtimiskaavio-demo.appspot.com/">http://pohtimiskaavio-demo.appspot.com/</a>. Then, go to the menu bar on the upper left corner of the graph and click OPEN CHART. Go to the location where you saved your graph and click the file to open it.</ol>
